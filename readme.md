# DRAFT

So, in this demo, we're doing two things:

- a fun particle system, implemented in (raw) webgl
- a (few) design-token driven UI components, implemented as Custom HTML elements (aka WebComponents)

This gives us three talking-points, that presents an approach to Frontend Engineering that, hopefully, resonates with you.

##

Use the platform.

- [x] raw webgl
      ui control of boids
      design tokens
      vanilla js and web components
      web-platform
