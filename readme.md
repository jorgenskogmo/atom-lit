# DRAFT

So, in this demo, we're doing three things:

- design-token driven css (implemented in figma)
- custom html elements (implemented with Lit base-class)
- webgl particle system (implemented in raw webgl)

This gives us three talking-points that presents an approach to Frontend Engineering that, hopefully, resonates with you.

## 1

Relationship between UX/UI, Design Engineering and Frontend Engineering 

## 2

Be an Engineer, not a Frameworker

## 3

Understand the underlying technology.
